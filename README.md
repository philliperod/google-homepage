This is the beginning of when you decided to make a change for yourself and for those around you. It's time to commmit to something that you know that you can excel at. Something that you should have pursued long ago, but it is okay. You started today. And keep taking the next step and look back of how much you have accomplished. I'm going to be proud of you when you look at this again at a later time and you are where you want to be and do what is passionate for you. I look forward in knowing that you will come back here and see the beginning.
